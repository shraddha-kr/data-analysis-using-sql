/*Writing SubQueries in SQL*/
-- Subquery Basics
-- First, the database runs the "inner query"â€”the part between the parentheses:
SELECT sub.*
FROM (
        SELECT *
        FROM tutorial.sf_crime_incidents_2014_01
        WHERE day_of_week = 'Friday'
     ) sub
WHERE sub.resolution = 'NONE'    
LIMIT 5

--Without a SubQuery
SELECT *
FROM tutorial.sf_crime_incidents_2014_01
WHERE day_of_week = 'Friday'
AND resolution = 'NONE'    
LIMIT 5

/*Write a query that selects all Warrant Arrests from the 
tutorial.sf_crime_incidents_2014_01 dataset, then wrap it in an outer query 
that only displays unresolved incidents. */
    SELECT sub.*
      FROM (
            SELECT *
              FROM tutorial.sf_crime_incidents_2014_01
             WHERE descript = 'WARRANT ARREST'
           ) sub
     WHERE sub.resolution = 'NONE'
     
--Using subqueries to aggregate in multiple stages
